## Usage

```typescript
import { PCIDSSControlsRegistry } from './controls-registry';

const registry = new PCIDSSControlsRegistry();
const controls = await registry.getAllControls();
const networkControls = await registry.getControlsByRequirement('REQ-1');
```

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Registry structure defined
- ✅ Control categories mapped
- 🚧 Individual control implementations (in progress)
- ⏳ Documentation templates (pending)
- ⏳ Assessment tools (pending)

## Compliance Level Support

- **Level 1**: Merchant processing over 6 million card transactions annually
- **Level 2**: Merchant processing 1 to 6 million transactions annually
- **Level 3**: Merchant processing 20,000 to 1 million e-commerce transactions annually
- **Level 4**: Merchant processing fewer than 20,000 e-commerce transactions annually

## Validation Methods

- **Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)**: For smaller merchants
- **Report on Compliance (ROC)**: For larger merchants
- **Attestation of Compliance (AOC)**: Validation document
