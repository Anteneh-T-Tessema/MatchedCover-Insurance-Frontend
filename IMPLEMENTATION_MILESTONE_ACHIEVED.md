## 📋 HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM

### **Primary Command:**
```bash
npm run execute:step-by-step
```

### **Individual Validation:**
```bash
npm run evaluate:status      # Check implementation status
npm run qa:comprehensive     # Run quality tests  
npm run validate:soc2        # Validate SOC 2 compliance
npm run test:comprehensive   # Run integration tests
```

### **Monitoring Progress:**
- Check `evaluation-output/` for detailed phase reports
- Monitor `qa-output/` for quality assessments
- Review `integration-test-output/` for system tests
- Track overall progress with generated reports
