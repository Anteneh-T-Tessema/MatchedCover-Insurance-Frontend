## Risk Assessment Results

### High Priority Risks
1. **Incomplete Access Reviews**
   - Risk Level: HIGH
   - Mitigation: Implement automated access certification
   - Target Date: Q2 2024

2. **Physical Security Gaps**
   - Risk Level: MEDIUM
   - Mitigation: Enhance facility access controls
   - Target Date: Q3 2024

3. **Incident Response Testing**
   - Risk Level: MEDIUM
   - Mitigation: Conduct tabletop exercises
   - Target Date: Q2 2024

### Risk Treatment Plan
- **Accept:** Low-impact operational risks
- **Mitigate:** Technical and process risks through control implementation
- **Transfer:** Certain risks through insurance and contracts
- **Avoid:** High-risk activities through policy restrictions

## Compliance Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Must Address)
- A.8.2 Privileged Access Rights: Needs enhanced monitoring
- A.7.1 Physical Security Perimeters: Requires assessment
- A.6.3 Information Security Training: Needs formal program

### Moderate Gaps (Address in Phase 2)
- A.5.8 Information Security in Project Management
- A.8.6 Capacity Management
- A.11.2 Removal of Access Rights

### Minor Gaps (Address in Phase 3)
