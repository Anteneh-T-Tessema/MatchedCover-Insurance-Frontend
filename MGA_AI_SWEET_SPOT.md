# MGA + AI Sweet Spot Implementation

## Overview

This implementation demonstrates the **hybrid MGA (Managing General Agent) + AI sweet spot** that modern insurtechs like Hippo, Root, and Lemonade use to start profitable while building toward becoming full insurers.

## üéØ The Sweet Spot Strategy
