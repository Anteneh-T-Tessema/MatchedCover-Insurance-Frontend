## SOC 2 & GRC Platform Security Implementation

### Overview

This guide outlines the security implementation for the SOC 2 & GRC Platform, ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices.

### Security Framework

#### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Data in transit protected with TLS 1.3
- PII data anonymized in non-production environments
- Regular data backup and recovery procedures

#### Access Control
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Principle of least privilege enforcement
- Regular access reviews and certification

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- OAuth 2.0 integration for third-party services
- Session management with automatic timeout
- Password policies enforced (complexity, rotation)

#### Network Security
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection
- DDoS protection and rate limiting
- Network segmentation and monitoring
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems

#### Vulnerability Management
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Patch management procedures
- Security incident response plan

### Compliance Controls

#### SOC 2 Type II Controls
- CC1: Control Environment
- CC2: Communication and Information
- CC3: Risk Assessment
- CC4: Monitoring Activities
- CC5: Control Activities
- CC6: Logical and Physical Access
- CC7: System Operations
- CC8: Change Management
- CC9: Risk Mitigation

#### Implementation Guidelines
- Continuous monitoring and alerting
- Audit trail and logging
- Data retention and disposal policies
- Employee security training
- Vendor risk management

### Security Monitoring

#### Logging and Monitoring
- Centralized logging with SIEM integration
- Real-time security monitoring
- Anomaly detection and alerting
- Security metrics and reporting

#### Incident Response
- 24/7 security operations center (SOC)
- Incident classification and escalation
- Forensic analysis capabilities
- Post-incident review and improvement

### Security Testing

#### Automated Testing
- Static application security testing (SAST)
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
- Interactive application security testing (IAST)
- Software composition analysis (SCA)

#### Manual Testing
- Regular penetration testing
- Code security reviews
- Security architecture reviews
- Social engineering assessments

### Compliance Reporting

#### Automated Reporting
- Real-time compliance dashboards
- Automated evidence collection
- Risk assessment reporting
- Exception tracking and remediation

#### Audit Preparation
- Continuous audit readiness
- Evidence management
- Control testing documentation
- Gap analysis and remediation plans
